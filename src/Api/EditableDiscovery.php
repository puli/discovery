/**
 * A discovery that supports the addition and removal of bindings and types.
 *
 * Binding types have a name and optionally one or more parameters. Binding
 * types can be added with the {@link addBindingType()} method:
 *
 * ```php
 * use Puli\Discovery\Api\Type\BindingParameter;
 * use Puli\Discovery\Api\Type\BindingType;
 *
 * $discovery->addBindingType(new BindingType('acme/message-catalog', array(
 *     new BindingParameter('translationDomain', null, 'messages'),
 * ));
 * ```
 *
 * Bindings can be added for these types with the {@link addBinding()} method:
 *
 * ```php
 * $discovery->addBinding(
 *     new ResourceBinding('/app/trans/errors.*.xlf', 'acme/xliff-messages', array(
 *         'translationDomain' => 'errors',
 *     ),
 * );
 * ```
 *
 * Use {@link findBindings()} to retrieve bindings for a given type:
 *
 * ```php
 * $bindings = $discovery->findBindings('acme/xliff-messages');
 *
 * foreach ($bindings as $binding) {
 *     foreach ($binding->getResources() as $resource) {
 *         $translator->addXlfCatalog(
 *             $resource->getLocalPath(),
 *             $binding->getParameter('translationDomain')
 *         );
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
